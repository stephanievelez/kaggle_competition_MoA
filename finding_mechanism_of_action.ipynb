Kaggle competitions can be very intimidating at times given they not only need good machine learning skills but also heavy domain knowledge. People always ask me how and where to start with kaggle , how do I manage to do good in competitions which require heavy domain knowledge , What level of knowledge do we need before starting a Kaggle competition ,etc . This notebook is meant to answer all those questions and is specially for anyone who wants to start with live competitions but is overwhelmed by the shear amount of things that a live competitions bring to the table. I was thinking of writing this from a long time now , but I was waiting for the right competition and here we have it , \"good old tabular competition\" which is a rare sight at kaggle.\n","\n","So without any further delay if you want to get started with live kaggle competitions or want to do good in kaggle competitions or need a detailed pathway on approaching kaggle competitions,etc , be sure to stick with me till the end of this notebook as <br>\n","<b> This is a step by step guide on How to Tackle Any Kaggle Competition : The Noob's Way </b>\n","\n","<font color='orange'>Note :- This notebook is a part of my Series : Mr KnowNothing's Weekends , in which I have planned a lot of more things ,if you liked this notebook and are interested in more such content you can know more about the series and follow along</font> [here](https://github.com/tanulsingh/Mr_KnowNothing-s-Weekends) \n","\n","<b> Important Note : All the steps/advices which I give in this notebook are from my personal experience and contain methods which I personally use. \n","I still consider myself a Kaggle Noob who is trying to learn,hence everything which I write might not be the optimal way , its just a guide to help people, I request all Kagglers to correct me in the comments if they feel there might be a better approach for what I am following now . I would really appreciate views of other Kagglers \n","    , Thanks</b>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.014508,"end_time":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.274143","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.259635","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<div class=\"list-group\" id=\"list-tab\" role=\"tablist\">\n","  <h3 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\"  role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\">Table of Contents</h3>\n","  <a class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action\" data-toggle=\"list\" href=\"#data\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"profile\">Phases of Kaggle/Competitive Data Science<span class=\"badge badge-primary badge-pill\">1</span></a>\n","    <a class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action\" data-toggle=\"list\" href=\"#data\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"profile\">My Advice on \"How to get Started with Kaggle\"<span class=\"badge badge-primary badge-pill\">2</span></a>\n","  <a class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action\" data-toggle=\"list\" href=\"#down\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"messages\">Step 1 : Understanding the Problem Statement and Gathering Basic(Initial Domain Knowledge) Domain Knowledge<span class=\"badge badge-primary badge-pill\">3</span></a>\n","  <a class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action\"  data-toggle=\"list\" href=\"#melt\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"settings\">Step 2 : Understanding the Evaluation Metric <span class=\"badge badge-primary badge-pill\">4</span></a>\n","  <a class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action\" data-toggle=\"list\" href=\"#eda\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"settings\">Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis ,Advanced Domain Knowledge Gathering and Choosing a Reliable CV<span class=\"badge badge-primary badge-pill\">5</span></a> \n","  <a class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action\" data-toggle=\"list\" href=\"#fe\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"settings\">Step 4: Setting up a Baseline and Gathering All your ideas in One place<span class=\"badge badge-primary badge-pill\">6</span></a>\n","  <a class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action\" data-toggle=\"list\" href=\"#pred\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"settings\">Step 5: Skimming through all the dicussion threads and Notebooks , writing down the Ideas to try<span class=\"badge badge-primary badge-pill\">7</span></a>\n","    <a class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action\" data-toggle=\"list\" href=\"#pred\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"settings\">Step 6: Perform Experiments and repeat<span class=\"badge badge-primary badge-pill\">8</span></a>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.308201Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.307083Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.312017Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.312651Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-28T22:42:55.977356Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.024023,"end_time":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.312848","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.288825","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Preliminaries\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.016093,"end_time":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.34322","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.327127","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <a id='data'>Step 1 : Understanding the Problem Statement ,Gathering Basic(Initial Domain Knowledge) Domain Knowledge and Data</a>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013934,"end_time":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.372123","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-28T23:14:38.358189","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <a id='data'>Step 2 : Understanding the Evaluation Metric </a>\n","\n","* Another very important thing to understand is what is the evaluation metric against which our model/solutions will be judged as then only we can do error analysis/back tracking to improve our model's predictions .
