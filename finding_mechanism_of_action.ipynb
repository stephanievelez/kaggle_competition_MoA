This project was very enticing since knowing the mechanism of action of medications is something that we are taught in school. In this project, I was able to use machine learning to predict the mechanism of action of certain drugs given certain data. The data given are genes and cells affected by some drugs (either positively or negatively) that have been analyzed and their mechanism of action given. With this data we are to train a model to then predict another set of drugs of unknown mechanism of action"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-28T23:54:24.653077Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-28T23:54:24.652035Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-28T23:54:24.656542Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-28T23:54:24.657134Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-28T23:24:14.698069Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.023695,"end_time":"2022-08-28T23:54:24.657365","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-28T23:54:24.63367","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Preliminaries\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-28T23:54:24.693426Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-28T23:54:24.692181Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-28T23:54:33.251714Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-28T23:54:33.252313Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-28T23:24:16.596461Z"},"papermill":{"duration":8.579173,"end_time":"2022-08-28T23:54:33.252543","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-28T23:54:24.67337","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","#reading csv\n","os.listdir('/kaggle/input/lish-moa')\n","train = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/lish-moa/train_features.csv') #training predictions\n","train_drug = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/lish-moa/train_drug.csv')\n","target = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/lish-moa/train_targets_scored.csv')\n","train_nonscored = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/lish-moa/train_targets_nonscored.csv')\n","test = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/lish-moa/test_features.csv') #need to predict this\n","sample= pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/lish-moa/sample_submission.csv')\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.015932,"end_time":"2022-08-28T23:54:33.284431","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-28T23:54:33.268499","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Now we choose the columns in our data that have a 'cp_time' of 48 hours, are treated with 'trt_cp' and dose of D1"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.015318,"end_time":"2022-08-28T23:54:33.317705","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-08-28T23:54:33.302387","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["The train and target are what we are going to be using to train the model.
